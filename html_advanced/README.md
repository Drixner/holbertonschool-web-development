## What is HTML

HTML, which stands for Hypertext Markup Language, is a standard markup language used for creating and structuring web pages and web applications. It forms the backbone of most web content and provides the structure and organization of the various elements on a web page, including text, images, links, forms, and multimedia.

## How to create an HTML page from a wireframe

To create an HTML page from a wireframe, you must translate the visual design and layout represented in the wireframe into HTML code.

## What is a markup language

A markup language is a system that uses markup tags or elements to provide structure and formatting instructions to content, making it easier to create, manage, and present information in a consistent and structured manner.

## What is a DOM

The Document Object Model (DOM) is a representation of a web page's structure as a tree of objects, accessible and manipulable through programming languages, primarily used for creating interactive and dynamic web applications.

## What is an attribute

Attributes play a crucial role in specifying the behavior and presentation of elements within markup languages. They allow developers to provide additional information to the browser or interpreter, enhancing the functionality and appearance of web pages and other structured documents.

## What is the purpose of each HTML tag

Each tag has a specific purpose, and web developers use them in combination to create structured and interactive web pages. HTML tags provide the essential building blocks for web content, enabling the presentation and functionality of websites on the internet.
